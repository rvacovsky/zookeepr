# Zookeepr

## Description

Zookeepr is a website that zoo personnel may use to catalog their animals and zookeepers.

## User Story

As an employee at a zoo, I want a place where I can enter the animals at the zoo as well as the zookeepers on staff. This catalog must allow me to also tack certain data elements for each group.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user enters the site, they can enter an animal's name and species, as well as their diet. The user can also multi-select personality traits from a list before adding them to the animal list. The user can also enter a zookeeper's name, age, and free text enter a favorite animal.

From the homepage, the user is also presented with a way to view all animals and zookeepers at the zoo. The user can filter these results based on the criteria entered.
